        }
        
        stage('Package') {

                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy to Dev') {
            when {

            }
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to development environment...'
                // Deployment steps

                echo 'Deploying to production environment...'
                // Production deployment steps
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully!'

            echo 'Pipeline failed!'
            mail to: 'team@example.com',
                 subject: "Failed Pipeline: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
