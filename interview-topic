https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1uJvX0ntpu3LGJlT6Iuy9LygTZeOJziCA

Here are some key components and concepts provided by the java.util.concurrent package:
Executor Framework:
                    Provides a standardized way to decouple task submission from task execution.
                   Includes interfaces like Executor, ExecutorService, and ScheduledExecutorService.
         Executors:
Utility classes for creating thread pools and executing tasks asynchronously.
Includes Executors class that provides factory methods for various types of thread pools.
Concurrent Collections:
                 Thread-safe collections that provide higher concurrency than their counterparts in the java.util    
                     package.
                 Examples include ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, and CopyOnWriteArrayList.
Synchronizers:
Classes that help control the flow of threads and coordinate their execution.
Examples include Semaphore, CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, and Phaser.
Locks:
More flexible synchronization mechanisms than intrinsic locks.
Includes interfaces like Lock, ReadWriteLock, and classes like ReentrantLock and ReentrantReadWriteLock.
Atomic Variables:
Provides classes that support atomic operations on single variables without requiring synchronization.
Examples include AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, and AtomicReference.
Fork/Join Framework:
A framework for parallelizing recursive divide-and-conquer tasks.
Includes classes like ForkJoinPool and RecursiveTask.
