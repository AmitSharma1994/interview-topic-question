## Sample Questions and Answers

### Project Architecture

**Q: Explain your project architecture**

**A:** Our project follows a microservices architecture with a set of independent services communicating through RESTful APIs and message queues. The frontend is built with React, which communicates with backend services through an API Gateway. Each microservice has its own database and is containerized using Docker. We use Kubernetes for orchestration and have implemented a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.

### Design Patterns

**Q: What design patterns did you use in your project?**

**A:** We implemented several design patterns:
1. Repository Pattern for data access abstraction
2. Factory Pattern for creating service instances
3. Strategy Pattern for implementing different payment processing methods
4. Observer Pattern for event handling
5. Circuit Breaker Pattern for handling service failures gracefully

### Security

**Q: How and where are database credentials stored in your project?**

**A:** We store database credentials in environment variables that are injected into our containers at runtime. For local development, we use a .env file that is excluded from version control. In production, we use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive information, which are encrypted at rest and only accessible to authorized services.
